# Main requirements file
# For full pipeline installation with all components
# Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 recommended (3.12 most tested)

# === IMPORTANT ===
# For component-specific installation, use:
#   - requirements-transcriber.txt  (heavy ML dependencies)
#   - requirements-analyzer.txt     (NLP dependencies)
#   - requirements-article-generator.txt (minimal dependencies)
#
# This file includes ALL components for convenience

-r requirements-transcriber.txt
-r requirements-analyzer.txt
-r requirements-article-generator.txt

# === NOTES ===
# 1. PyTorch dependencies are heavy (~2GB). For GPU support:
#    pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
#
# 2. If you only need specific components:
#    - Article generator only: pip install -r requirements-article-generator.txt
#    - Analyzer only: pip install -r requirements-analyzer.txt
#    - Transcriber only: pip install -r requirements-transcriber.txt
#
# 3. Known compatibility:
#    - Tested on Python 3.12 (recommended)
#    - Should work on Python 3.10-3.12
#    - Python 3.13+ may have compatibility issues with some dependencies
